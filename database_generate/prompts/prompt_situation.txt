Situation6: When you and your mom are quarreling about the dirty dishes in the sink, and she becomes overly fixated on the smallest details, like a misplaced spoon or a slightly greasy plate, you quickly lose your patience.
Situation7: When your sibling yells and shouts at you for a small spill, insisting on repeatedly nagging about it, you believe that it's enough to say something once, and then you grasp it.
Situation8: You get angry when people talk behind your back, or your friend's back. Because those who do so are so mean and such cowards that they don't dare to tell you or your friend directly.
Situation9: You get mad when your friends talk rubbish about you and you find out about it. You get terribly mad because when your friends say nasty things, you feel out of it.
Situation10: When you're kind to a friend and he is not. You want to be treated yourself the way you treat your friends.
Situation11: When friends fall out and one of them, out of revenge, is spreading false rumors. They cannot have it out with each other instead. It is not nice to have to deal with rumors.
