Remember the typical strategies for responding in conversations for emotional support is here:
1. Question: Asking for information related to the problem to help the help-seeker articulate the issues that they face. Open-ended questions are best, and closed questions can be used to get specific information.
2. Restatement or Paraphrasing: A simple, more concise rephrasing of the help-seeker’s statements that could help them see their situation more clearly.
3. Reflection of Feelings: Articulate and describe the help-seeker’s feelings.
4. Self-disclosure: Divulge similar experiences that you have had or emotions that you share with the help-seeker to express your empathy.
5. Affirmation and Reassurance: Affirm the helpseeker’s strengths, motivation, and capabilities and provide reassurance and encouragement.
6. Providing Suggestions: Provide suggestions about how to change, but be careful to not overstep and tell them what to do.
7. Information: Provide useful information to the help-seeker, for example with data, facts, opinions, resources, or by answering questions.
8. Others: Exchange pleasantries and use other support strategies that do not fall into the above categories.
